- `conv_new.m`: Performs convolution using a different method.
- `dft.m`: Discrete Fourier Transform implementation.
- `fold.m`: Function for folding signals.
- `generate_conv_new_dependent_sequence.m`: Generates sequences dependent on the convolution method in `conv_new.m`.
- `generate_dft_dependent_sequence.m`: Generates sequences dependent on the DFT implementation in `dft.m`.
- `generate_impulse_dependent_sequence.m`: Generates sequences dependent on impulse functions.
- `generate_ramp_dependent_sequence.m`: Generates sequences dependent on ramp functions.
- `generate_step_dependent_sequence.m`: Generates sequences dependent on step functions.
- `my_impulse.m`: Implements custom impulse functions.
